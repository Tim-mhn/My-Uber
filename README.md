# My-Uber

Uber-inspired java app with a CLUI and a GUI.

As a user of this app, you can create users (customers + drivers) and cars, move the latter, ask for the price of rides depending on the type of ride, book ride and simulate the moving of users.

Go to MyCLUI or MyGUI class and run the main method.
